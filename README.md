# Simple-object-based-calculator

Just showing a simple (but basically pointless!) example of how you can use inheritance to build an offshoot of a class.

I've made a normal and a "scientific" calculator, the only difference being the scientific has one more function.

Each has a separate HTML page which is a bit lazy, but they link to each other and if you use them you'll see they post to themselves rather than going off to another page, and they preselect your chosen values etc.

Hopefully some useful bits you can learn from it.
